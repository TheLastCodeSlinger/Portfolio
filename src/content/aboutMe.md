I’m <span>Michael</span> , a 26 years old self-taught <span>Front-end</span> developer , from <span>Germany</span> .

After finishing school, I studied _Economics_ in Hannover for 1 year. During this time, I had a _Computer Science_ course focussing on _Java_. Compared to the other subjecs, I really enjoyed programming and switched to Computer Science. Back in 2018, I wasn't able to focus on studying for several reasons. I took a break and worked part-time in retail and other jobs. 

When Corona struck, I knew it was _time for a change_. Without the different kind of courses during university, I could focus on _programming_. I quickly started to <span>love Javascript</span>, and in November 2020, I decided to _take the risk and quit my job_. I've been studying Front-end development full time ever since. 

During this time, I took online courses like [Advanced CSS and Sass: Flexbox, Grid, Animations and More!](https://www.udemy.com/advanced-css-and-sass/) [The Complete Javascript Course](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-javascript-course), [Javascript30](https://javascript30.com/), [ES6](https://es6.io), [React: The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux), [React - The complete Guide(incl. Hooks, Router, Redux)](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/) and also watched countless youtube videos about Javascript and React.

Because we know the best way to learn is to practice, I also did a bunch of personal projects with the knowledge I gathered from the courses, you can check them on my <scroll-link to='portfolio'>portfolio</scroll-link>. 

I always want to _learn more_, _do more_, and _be more_. I’m also a firm believer that we should <span>never settle</span>.

I’m _hard working_, _super curious_, _passionate_, _committed_, and also a _fast learner_!
