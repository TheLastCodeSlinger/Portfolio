A Movie Library made with React. This was my first project after finishing a React Course. It fetches information from an API, and displays it in a nice way. You also get recommended movies based on the one you're watching, and you can also click on an Actor, and check information about him/her as well as movies that same actor enters. It uses React Router, lazy loading on images and error handling.
