Alan Watts has taught me a lot. This site has his biography and some of his best quotes. I searched for almost 100 quotes and stored them in a file. The quote-generator will start with a random quote, and lets you go for- and backward. This site is connected to Firebase Auth & Database. If you are logged in, you can add/remove your favorite quote.
